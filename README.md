# Project 1
Consumer Loan Assistant Project

This project will help you get a handle on consumer debt. The Consumer Loan Assistant Project you would build computes payments and loan terms given balance and interest information. We look at focus traversal among controls, how to do input validation, and the message box for user feedback.

# Project 2
Home Inventory Manager Project

 The Home Inventory Manager Project helps you keep track of your valuable belongings. For every item in your inventory, the program stores a description, location, serial number, purchase information, and even a photo. A printed inventory is available - very useful for insurance purposes. This coding Internship project would re-inforce some object-oriented programming concepts and how to print from a project.
